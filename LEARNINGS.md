- Scrolling X i feel so behind. I see people who were level with me in 2017 doing shit that looks so cool. I know I've done a lot too. One day at a time, one foot in front of the other. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard, or whatever Kobe said.
- Java is my comfort zone but python is indeed so much more flexible.
